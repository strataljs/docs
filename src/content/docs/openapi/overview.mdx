Stratal generates a complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification from the Zod schemas you already use for validation. One schema drives both runtime validation and your API documentation, so the two can never drift apart.

## What you get

Every `@Route`-decorated controller method is automatically included in a generated OpenAPI spec. The `OpenAPIModule` is registered as core infrastructure during application startup, so there is nothing to set up for basic usage.

<Aside type="tip">
  If your controllers already use `@Route` with Zod schemas, you have OpenAPI documentation. No additional annotations are required.
</Aside>

Out of the box, you get:

- **Automatic OpenAPI 3.0 spec** generated from your Zod schemas and route decorators.
- **Interactive API docs** served by [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) at `/api/docs`.
- **JSON spec endpoint** at `/api/openapi.json` for importing into tools like Postman or Insomnia.
- **Built-in security scheme definitions** for bearer tokens, API keys, and session cookies.
- **Common error responses** (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 500) auto-included on every route.
- **Unreferenced schema pruning** so the spec only contains schemas your routes actually use.

## How it works

The flow from code to interactive docs looks like this:

1. You define Zod schemas and attach them to controller methods via the `@Route` decorator.
2. At startup, Stratal registers each route with [`@hono/zod-openapi`](https://github.com/honojs/middleware/tree/main/packages/zod-openapi), which builds the full OpenAPI document.
3. When a request hits the JSON spec endpoint, Stratal filters out hidden routes, prunes unused schemas, and returns the final spec.
4. The Scalar UI reads that spec and renders an interactive API reference.

<Aside type="note">
  The generated specification follows **OpenAPI 3.0.0**. Stratal uses Hono's OpenAPI integration under the hood, so any tooling that supports OpenAPI 3.0 will work with the generated spec.
